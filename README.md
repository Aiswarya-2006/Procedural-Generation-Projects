# Procedural Generation Project

This project demonstrates procedural generation techniques used to create dynamic and randomized game environments. The main goal of the project is to understand how algorithmic methods can be used to generate levels automatically, improving replayability and reducing the need for manually designed content.

The project was developed by following a tutorial, which helped in learning the core concepts behind procedural generation, including randomness, level variation, and basic optimization techniques. Through this project, I explored how different parameters affect level generation and how procedural logic can be applied in game development workflows.

This project served as a learning exercise to strengthen my understanding of game design principles, procedural content generation, and practical implementation using a game engine.
